Pybricks for *LEGO Education SPIKE Prime* and *LEGO MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor*
is currently still in beta.

To try the beta version, you can
[follow these instructions](https://github.com/pybricks/support/issues/591).

Not everything works yet, so please use this version with caution.

If you're a beginner, it's better to
start with [one of the other hubs](../technic-boost-city).
