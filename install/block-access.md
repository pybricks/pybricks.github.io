**Updated 21 December 2023:** New purchases are now processed
automatically by [our new store](../../premium/).

Previous purchases via Patreon will continue to work as before.

If you have trouble signing in, please email us at _sales@pybricks.com_ with
your order number.

For your convenience, you will automatically get an upgrade to a new licence
code in the next few weeks. This lets you use the app without an account,
even offline.
