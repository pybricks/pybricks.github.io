Block coding is available exclusively to our supporters on Patreon. You can
sign up for a monthly subscription or make a one-time pledge in our shop for
yearly or lifetime access.

## Before you sign up

Block coding is currently in beta. Some things may not work as
expected. Please try the free trial before you make a purchase.

Please try running a free Python program to make sure your hub and computer
are compatible. We cannot provide refunds due to connectivity
issues.

## Monthly subscription

You can sign up for a monthly subscription on [Patreon]. You can try it out for
a week and cancel at any time.

Once signed up, you can unlock block coding right away using your Patreon
account when you open a new project in [Pybricks][Pybricks Beta].

## Pybricks lifetime access

If you prefer to make a one-time purchase for lifetime access, you can do so
in our [Patreon Shop].

Unlike subscriptions, purchases are processed manually, which may
take up to 2 business days.

Once processed, you can sign in to [Pybricks Beta] using your Patreon
account without a subscription. You can also sign in with your Google, Facebook,
or Apple account as long as you use the same email address.

## Give Pybricks lifetime access as a gift!

You can also give Pybricks Lifetime Access as a gift via our [Patreon Shop]. 
This is a great way to support us and give a gift that keeps on giving!

It works just like normal lifetime access, but you give it to someone else.

Please email us at _sales@pybricks.com_ with your order number and the email
address that should get access on your behalf.

## Access for robotics teams

We also have a team season pass for robotics teams. This pass gives all team
members of a single competing team access to block coding for one year.

Your coach can purchase the team season pass in our [Patreon Shop]. Please
email us at _sales@pybricks.com_ with your order number and the email addresses
that should get access.

Each team member can then sign in to [Pybricks Beta] using their Patreon,
Google, Facebook, or Apple account using their email address without charge.

## Access for schools

Please email us at _sales@pybricks.com_ to discuss options for schools and
other organizations.

## Issues while signing in

If you have trouble signing in, please email us at _sales@pybricks.com_ with
your order number and the email address you used to sign up.
