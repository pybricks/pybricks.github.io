If your LEGO set works with a Bluetooth app, chances are it works
with Pybricks too.

## Technic / BOOST / City / SPIKE / MINDSTORMS

All modern battery-powered LEGO sets use *Powered Up* technology. This includes
programmable hubs, motors, and sensors, which all feature the *same connector*.

Pybricks can be installed by upgrading the firmware on the hub. Once installed,
they all work the same way.

## MINDSTORMS EV3

Pybricks also continues to support LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3.

Instead of the online editor used for the newer hubs, you'll use Visual Studio
Code to write your programs.

For EV3, Pybricks supports only MicroPython coding, not block-based coding.
