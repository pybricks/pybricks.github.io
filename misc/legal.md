# Privacy Policy: Pybricks Website / App
_Effective Date: January 8, 2024_

Thank you for using Pybricks! This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use,
and disclose information on our website (pybricks.com) and our web app
(code.pybricks.com and beta.pybricks.com). Please read this Privacy Policy
carefully.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1. Pybricks.com

Our website, pybricks.com, does not collect any personalized information. We
may collect aggregated, non-personal information such as ip-addresses for
analytics purposes, such as the number of visitors and popular pages.

### 1.2. code.pybricks.com and beta.pybricks.com

Our web app, code.pybricks.com (and its beta variant beta.pybricks.com), is
designed to run offline and does not inherently collect any personalized
information. In particular, your programs, app settings and preferences are
stored within your own browser web storage.

The app does allow users to unlock
additional features with a license code or a subscription, for which
information may be stored by one of our partners, described below.

## 2. Using Pybricks with Patreon or a license code via FastSpring

To unlock additional features on code.pybricks.com and beta.pybricks.com, users
may purchase a license code via our partner FastSpring, a third-party
e-commerce platform. FastSpring processes user information according to the
[FastSpring Privacy Policy](https://fastspring.com/privacy/). We do not handle
or store any payment information on our servers.

Similarly, users may unlock the app via Patreon, a platform that allows
supporters to gain exclusive access to creator content. See the [Patreon
Privacy Policy](https://privacy.patreon.com/policies/en/) for more information.
If you purchased access via the Patreon shop, we store only your email address
and order number to facilitate logging in. When you switch to using a license
code, we will eventually delete your information from our server so that only
the information stored with Fastspring and/or Patreon remains.

## 3. Cookies

We may use cookies on our sites for analytics and performance purposes. These
cookies do not collect personally identifiable information. However, please be
aware that certain third-party services or scripts integrated into our site may
use cookies for their purposes. Please refer to the respective privacy policies
of those services for more information. We may use third-party web analytics
services on our website, such as Google Analytics. These service providers may
use cookies and other technologies to help us analyze how users use the Site.
The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected
directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your
use of the Site.

## 4. Links to External Sites

Our sites may contain links to external websites. We are not responsible for
the privacy practices or content of these external sites.

## 5. Security

We have implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures designed
to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized
access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that
unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use
your personal information for improper purposes.
## 6. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time.
Changes will be effective upon posting the updated Privacy Policy on this page.
## 7. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact
us at sales@pybricks.com.

# Terms and conditions for using Pybricks Block Coding

_Effective Date: January 8, 2024_

Thank you for using Pybricks block coding! These terms and conditions ("Terms")
govern your use of the Pybricks app at code.pybricks.com and beta.pybricks.com
("the App"). By using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to
these Terms, please do not use the App.

## 1. License Code and App Usage

### 1.1. License Code or Subscription

To access certain features of the App such as block coding, users may purchase
a license code through the webshop provided by Fastspring or subscribe via
Patreon.

### 1.2. License Usage

If users purchase a license, they are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable
right to use the App for personal or educational purposes. Users with the
Workshop License may use the app in commercial workshops or training sessions
for the duration of the license on the given number of devices.

Within the respective use cases of each license, you may use Pybricks on
multiple devices. For example, you may use a personal license on your own
computer and tablet, but you may not share your license code with a friend.

Users are responsible for maintaining
the confidentiality of their license code and are solely responsible for any
activity that occurs under their code. Unauthorized distribution, sharing, or
resale of license codes is strictly prohibited.

If you (or your students) have accidentally shared your license code or posted
it online publicly, please contact us at sales@pybricks.com to request a
replacement code. We reserve the right to deny replacements or deactivate it if
we suspect abuse of the license code.

### 1.3. Meaning of "Perpetual" Licenses

Some of our licenses have a perpetual duration. This means that you will not be
charged again after the initial purchase. You will receive future updates and
add-ons for free.

However, we cannot guarantee indefinite support or commitment that the web app
will function flawlessly forever. This is why we kindly ask you to run a test
program first.

As technology evolves and circumstances change, maintaining compatibility and
providing support for older devices, operating systems, and browsers may become
impractical or untenable.

Please see the [refund policy](#refund-policy-for-pybricks-block-coding) for
more details and the case of discontinuation of the app.

## 2. User Obligations

Users agree to:
- Provide accurate, current, and complete information during the
license code purchase process.
- Use the App in compliance with all applicable
laws and regulations.
- Refrain from engaging in any activity that could harm the
App or its users.
- Refrain from hacking or similar practices to gain
unauthorized access to restricted functionality of the App or the site.

## 3. Open Source Components

Portions of the App are open source and may utilize open source components. The
licenses for these components are included within the App. Users agree to
comply with the terms of the applicable open source licenses when using the
open source portions of the App. Most of our open source components are
published on [GitHub](https://github.com/pybricks/).

## 4. Disclaimers

Use at Your Own Risk: The App is provided "as is" without any warranties,
express or implied. Users use the App at their own risk.

No Warranty of Accuracy: We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any
content within the App.

Loss of Data: User programs and settings are stored in your own browser.
We have no access to your data and are not responsible for any loss of data.
You are responsible for keeping regular backups of your data and programs.

Limitation of Liability: We are not responsible for any
loss, injury, or damage resulting from the use of the App. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
special, consequential, or punitive damages.

## 5. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. Changes will
be effective upon posting the updated Terms on this page.

## 6. Termination

We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to the App at our
discretion, without notice. If you are using Pybricks with a license code,
please read the refund policy below for more information.

## 7. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms, please contact us at
sales@pybricks.com

not provided, license holders may request a partial refund covering the
remaining months of their first year after purchase, regardless of license type.

the Patreon subscription before deciding to purchase a license. Users are
