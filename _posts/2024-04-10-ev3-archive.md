The first versions of Pybricks (1.0 and 2.0) were released for LEGO MINDSTORMS
EV3, launched in partnership with [LEGO Education][lego-education]. These
versions are based on [ev3dev][ev3dev]. You can code the EV3 using [Microsoft
Visual Studio Code][installation].

As a result, it is not compatible with our newer, simpler [online
interface][pybricks-code] launched in version 3.0. Pybricks for EV3
therefore does not support block-based coding. For block-based coding, you can
use the official LEGO software, as shown below.

# How can I code EV3 robots?

Several apps are available:
- [EV3 Lab (Education Edition)][ev3-lab]: Also known as "EV3-G". This is the
  original software that came with the Education EV3 set. This works on Windows
  machines, as well as Apple Macintosh with macOS 10.14 or older.
- [EV3 Lab (Home Edition)][ev3-lab-home]: Same coding environment as above, but
  with slightly different features and content for the respective 31313 set.
  This is the version used in most guidebooks for EV3, such as the LEGO
  MINDSTORMS EV3 Discovery Book. Note: the aforementioned link takes you
  directly to the 600 MB download
- [EV3 Classroom][ev3-classroom]: This is the latest version of the software
  that works on Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS. It is based on Scratch, but
  lacks most of the more advanced features from the original software. For
  example, you cannot link multiple EV3 bricks to build a bigger robot.
- [EV3 Python][lego-education]: This is the official Python solution for EV3,
  based on Pybricks and ev3dev. Various other solutions exist for
  [ev3dev][ev3dev], including community support for other programming
  languages.

# Where can I find MINDSTORMS EV3 Python projects?
Once you've followed the [installation instructions][installation], you can
find examples in the following resources:

- [Building instructions for EV3 Education models][ev3-building-instructions].
- [Documentation and core set example programs][pybricks-ev3-api]. On that
  page, use the left menu to find examples for the Educator Bot,
  the Color Sorter, the Robot Arm, the Puppy, Gyro Boy, the Elephant, the Stair
  Climber, Tank Bot, and Znap.
- [Community examples][pybricks-projects-ev3] on GitHub, including for the
  home edition models.
