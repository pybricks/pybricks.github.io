**... and the planet, one programmable brick at a time.**

LEGO® MINDSTORMS® was discontinued. End of story, right? Well, not so fast.
We can fix this together—and you can [help](#become-a-mindstorms-legend)!

# Broken apps and a big pile of e-waste

It's hard to find definitive numbers, but there are at least hundreds of
thousands, if not millions, of MINDSTORMS sets out there. For context, that's
more than 10 times the height of Mount Everest if you stack them all up. It's
a _lot_.

Sadly, an ever-increasing number of them are no longer being used. Regular LEGO
bricks last a long time, even across generations. But when it comes to electronic
LEGO products, we seem resigned to the fact that they work for just a
few years, like most other consumer electronics.

Any gadget that requires a computer or smartphone becomes obsolete quickly as
the original apps are abandoned or stop working on modern devices. The same
has happened with previous generations of LEGO MINDSTORMS, and is now gradually
happening with the latest two: EV3 and Robot Inventor.

Some die-hard fans keep old laptops around just to keep their LEGO
MINDSTORMS sets running, but this isn't feasible for most people, and certainly
not for schools.

Besides technical obsolescence, MINDSTORMS EV3 is being left behind because it
no longer feels relevant for today's curriculum. But why is that? We want to
challenge both of these narratives.

We admire the LEGO brand and The LEGO Group's efforts to become more
sustainable, but we believe they can do better when it comes to bricks with
electronic components. We're here to demonstrate that this can totally be done.

# Refreshing a legendary robotics kit

Before you read on, consider this for a minute:

> Which past or current LEGO set has a _smart hub_, _motors_, a _color sensor_, and a _distance sensor_?

Yep — _all_ of the LEGO robot sets from the past 20 years!

{% include gallery id="gallery-starterbots" layout="half" caption="These
typical introductory rovers are built with SPIKE Prime, MINDSTORMS Robot
Inventor, MINDSTORMS EV3, and MINDSTORMS NXT. Spanning
almost 20 years, is there anything fundamentally different? With
a fresh take on software, these all work great with modern curriculum." %}

This includes MINDSTORMS NXT, MINDSTORMS EV3, MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor, SPIKE
Prime, and SPIKE Essential. With some creativity, this definition even includes
LEGO BOOST, LEGO Powered Up and Technic, and WeDo 1.0 and 2.0.

What sets them apart is not the technology, but the out-of-the-box play
and learning experience. Each set had its own unique and exciting play
experience designed for the relevant audience at that time.

While each of these were brilliant in their own right, some of them now feel
outdated or don't work anymore. But since the technology hasn't fundamentally
changed for 20 years, this presents us with a unique opportunity: invent a
modern and future-proof play experience for _all_ LEGO robotics sets.

This is what we have been doing successfully with Pybricks for the past 5
years, and now it is time to bring EV3 into the fold!

# What is Pybricks for EV3?

Pybricks for LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 will be a complete refresh of the EV3 play
experience, all without purchasing new stuff.

It will work with modern computers and curriculum, right alongside
SPIKE and other newer platforms. The EV3 starts and stops instantly, and you
can code it with MicroPython or blocks.

{% include scaled.html path="/learn/intro/codepreview.png" caption="Everything you love about Pybricks, soon also for EV3." %}

Put another way, the EV3 used to be like an older Raspberry Pi. We make
it work more like Micro:Bit, which is much more beginner-friendly and
classroom-ready.

With this upgrade, your EV3 comes back to life with many years to go, at home
and in the classroom. Not just for teaching or play, but also for competing in
FIRST LEGO League (FLL) and the World Robotics Olympiad (WRO).

## What can it do?

Everything you love about Pybricks for MINDSTORMS Inventor and SPIKE Prime will
also come to LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3, as far as the hardware allows. This means
an easy setup, effective sensor and motor control, and accurate driving.

You will write programs for the EV3 brick using the [same Pybricks MicroPython
commands](https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest) and blocks that exist for all of
the currently supported hubs.

The first release will focus on the essential features, like support for all
the official EV3 motors and sensors. Note that it will not do _everything_ that
the EV3 could possibly do from day one. But since the new firmware is open
source too, we expect to add exciting new features over time.

Oh — remember that the EV3 felt sluggish and slow to boot? Especially
compared to the new hubs? We've solved that:

## Did Pybricks not already support EV3?

Kind of. The earliest iterations of Pybricks (1.0 and 2.0) ran on ev3dev Linux.
It is still (and will remain) available on the [LEGO Education website](https://education.lego.com/en-us/product-resources/mindstorms-ev3/teacher-resources/python-for-ev3/). You
needed a particular type of microSD card, a now-outdated flashing tool, and
Visual Studio Code. It also took a long time to boot. This was great for hackers
and early adopters, but it just isn't suitable for beginner-level classrooms.

Pybricks 3.0 has made huge leaps since then. Updating the hub and writing code
(blocks and Python) works in your browser without additional installs. You can
basically just code, and your smart hub boots instantly. The user commands
("the API") are still unchanged though. We like to keep things running!

Schools, FLL teams, WRO teams, and home users are already successfully
using Pybricks to build, play, invent, and win with a wide variety of modern
robotics sets. We think that the EV3 deserves to be part of the same experience.
Just plug and play!

## Is EV3 still relevant? Where's the AI?

Sure, AI might be amazing---and yes, you _could_ combine it with Pybricks if
you really wanted to---but it is not our focus.

No matter how you'll code, a motor is still going to have to rotate,
lights still need to blink, and a robot still needs to drive straight. 

Our focus is on getting these fundamentals absolutely right across a wide range
of robotics systems. This ensure that Pybricks is future-proof even as the
latest trends in STEM education constantly evolve.

In fact, since more advanced processing like artificial intelligence tends to
happen on devices like your phone or the cloud anyway, these fancy additions
work equally well with newer sets like SPIKE as they do with older sets like
EV3, since we've made the underlying robotics framework the same throughout.

## Will it be free and open source?

Just like Pybricks for the other LEGO hubs, the firmware and Python coding
environment are free and open source. We are working on this around the
clock.

We'll also have _optional_ add-on features like block-based coding, which help
us fund our mission. Naturally, prior supporters will automatically get
access when we enable this for EV3! Thanks again for
your [support](#become-a-mindstorms-legend).

## Where are we now?

Developments will be gradually published on
[GitHub](https://github.com/pybricks/pybricks-micropython) in the months to
come. We are currently working on implementations for:

- Booting the EV3 instantly.
- Installing the firmware. No SD card needed.
- Running MicroPython programs directly on the brick.
- Large and Medium Motors, and Drive Bases.
- EV3 Touch Sensor, EV3 Gyro Sensor, EV3 Color Sensor, EV3 Ultrasonic Sensor,
  EV3 Infrared Sensor.

The major remaining steps towards a first release include:

- Implementing USB or Bluetooth connectivity.
- Re-implementing firmware installation in the browser.
- Re-implementing code download in the browser.
- Integrating documentation for all hubs in one release.

By popular request, we'll also list the features that could work _technically_.
These _could_ be added in future releases if enough users are interested:
- Legacy motor and sensor support.
- File management and sound support.
- Third-party sensor support.
- USB host connectivity to connect multiple bricks.

## What about MINDSTORMS NXT?

Great question. While we can't make any promises yet, we have confirmed that
the NXT brick is powerful enough to run Pybricks, which is a super exciting
first step. If there is sufficient interest in this initiative for EV3, then
MINDSTORMS NXT will be next!

# Try it out in the classroom

If you want to try out an early version of Pybricks for EV3 in your classroom
once it is nearly ready, we'd love to [hear from you](/learn/intro/story-mission/#who-are-we).

Do you have unused EV3 sets? Would you consider donating them to another school
that wouldn't normally be able to afford robotics in the classroom? Please get
in touch as well!

All of our progress is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pybricks/pybricks-micropython),
but it isn't quite ready for beginning users just yet. If you've reached out to
us about trying it out, you'll be the first to hear from us when it's ready!

We're currently working on USB communication between the Pybricks Code web app and
the EV3 brick. This is needed to install the firmware or run programs.

It has proven quite tricky to get older hardware like EV3 to work
with modern WebUSB standards, especially on Windows. We'll get there though--stay tuned!
