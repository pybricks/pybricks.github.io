  Control the LEGO速 Technic Liebherr Crawler Crane (42146) with
  the Xbox Controller. No phone needed!
---

In this project, we will show you how to control the LEGO速 Technic Liebherr
Crawler Crane (42146) with the Xbox Controller.

This gives you precise control over each of the crane's functions without
having to use a phone or tablet. You can drive it around with the left
joystick and control the functions with the buttons and triggers.

This crane has two hubs, so we'll also show you how to connect them via Bluetooth.

# Requirements

To follow this project, you will need the following:

- {% include setlink.html id=42146 %}
- {% include setlink.html id="xbox" %} or {% include setlink.html id="xbox-elite-2" %}

See <a href="https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/iodevices/xboxcontroller.html#compatible-controllers" target="_blank">
this overview</a> for all compatible models.

# Understanding the code

This project has two programs, one for each hub. The hub in the base connects
to the Xbox Controller and drives the vehicle. It also calculates the required
speeds of the crane functions based on your input, and broadcasts these to the
other hub in the crane.

The crane hub receives these messages and controls the crane functions
accordingly. While the order of installation doesn't matter, it's practical
to download and run the crane program first. Because it simply starts and stops
the crane functions based on the incoming signals, you can customize all the
actions in the program for the hub in the base instead.

When sending numbers, communication works best if you send small numbers. So
we just send the percentage values from the joysticks, and multiply them by
a factor in the crane program to get the desired speed.

In this project, you have two hubs. Installation works the same for both.
During installation, you can give each hub a unique name such as `Base` or
`Crane`, which makes it easier to tell them apart when you connect later.

# The crane in action

When you're ready, you can operate the crane as shown below!

Communication between the two hubs works best if you disconnect them from your
computer.
