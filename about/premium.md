- *Bring all your smart LEGOÂ® bricks together in a single app for endless
  possibilities and creativity.*
- *Make your LEGO City trains, BOOST creatures, Technic machines, or
  SPIKE and MINDSTORMS robots come alive!*
- *Learn more about the possibilities in the [press release](/about/new-pybricks-blocks/)*.

Block coding is exclusively available to our supporters. You can get access
with a monthly subscription or a one-time purchase.

## Option 1: Use Patreon

A monthly subscription via Patreon is a good option if you'd like to try out
Pybricks block coding for free and cancel anytime.

<a href="https://www.patreon.com/pybricks/membership" target="_blank" class="btn btn--primary"><i class="fas fa-user"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Join on Patreon</a>

Once you're signed up, you can unlock the app using your
Patreon account when you open a [block project][app].

<small>By signing up, you agree to the [terms and conditions](../legal).</small>

## Option 2: Purchase a licence

You can purchase a licence in our store. You'll receive an email
with one or more codes that you can activate [as shown below][using-license].

<a href="https://pybricks.onfastspring.com/" target="_blank" class="btn btn--primary"><i class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Visit the Pybricks store</a>

A licence works well if you prefer a one-time purchase without making any
accounts. Localized payment options are available.

We have licenses for individuals, teams, schools, and companies. Either annual or perpetual. Read what this means [here][perpetual].

If you tried the monthly subscription first, don't forget to cancel it.

*Note: Before you purchase, please make sure your system is compatible by
[running a test program][test]. We cannot provide refunds arising from
connectivity issues.*

<small>By purchasing a license, you agree to the [terms and conditions](../legal).</small>

## How to unlock the app with a license

just click the user icon in the top right corner.

Enter your licence code and click _Activate_, as shown below.

You can see the status of your license by clicking on the user icon again. This

## Running a free test program

Before you purchase a license to access block coding, we kindly ask you to run
a simple test program to make sure your system is compatible.

To try it, follow these steps:

- Open the [app][app], click the gear (âš™) icon, and
  click _Install Pybricks Firmware_. Follow the steps for your hub.
- Then click the file icon (ðŸ—Ž) and the (+) symbol to create a new block project.
  Just close the login prompt that appears. You'll see a program like the one
  below with a few blocks.
- Connect to the hub using the
  Bluetooth icon  and Click the _Run_ button (â–¶) to run the program.
  You should see
  `Hello, Pybricks!` printed in the console at the bottom.

If you see this message, your system is compatible. You can find more details
in our [installation guide](/install/). Congrats -- this was the hardest part.
Now you can start coding!

Once you're signed up, you can see the full toolbox and start building programs.

## What does "perpetual" mean?

Some of our licenses have a perpetual duration. This means that you will not be
charged again after the initial purchase. You will receive future updates and
add-ons for free.

You can even deactivate the license and use it on another device.

However, we cannot guarantee indefinite support or commitment
that the web app will function flawlessly forever. This is why we kindly ask
you to run a [test program][test] first.

As technology evolves and
circumstances change, maintaining compatibility and providing support for older
devices, operating systems, and browsers may become impractical or untenable.

Please see the [terms and conditions](../legal) for more details.

## Stable and beta version

There are two versions of the Pybricks app:

- [Pybricks Code](https://code.pybricks.com/) is the version that most users
  should use. It is well tested and stable. It is updated several times a year.

- [Pybricks Beta](https://beta.pybricks.com/) is frequently updated with new
  features and bug fixes. It is recommended for experienced users who want to
  try out new features and provide feedback.

Each version has its own set of user programs. You can always download your
files in one version and upload them in the other.

If you code with blocks, you can login to both versions at the same time.
