***June 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2021 - Pybricks Headquarters***: Today, the Pybricks
team presents the first Python coding release for LEGO® Powered Up. Now LEGO
fans and students of all ages can learn to code with Python and make their LEGO
creations come alive.

Whether you want to make smart train layouts, autonomous
Technic machines, or interactive BOOST creatures, you can do it with Pybricks.

Pybricks brings the popular (Python-based) MicroPython coding language to all
LEGO hubs, including the LEGO BOOST Move Hub, the LEGO City Hub, and the LEGO
Technic Hub. It supports all Powered Up motors and sensors: if the cable
fits, it just works.

Pybricks is beginner-friendly and easy to use. No prior coding experience
required. There’s no need to install complicated apps or libraries either.
Just go to
[https://code.pybricks.com](https://code.pybricks.com), update the firmware,
and start coding. Numerous real-world examples will get you started in no time.

Meanwhile, more seasoned builders and coders will enjoy advanced features such
as color sensor calibration and accurate motor position and speed control.
Combined with the endless possibilities of MicroPython, you can really take
your creations to the next level.

New users can learn how to get started at [https://pybricks.com](https://pybricks.com).
This includes
installation tutorials and coding projects shared by the Pybricks community,
ultimately aiming for examples for all Powered Up sets ever released.

Pybricks Python coding is entirely free and open source, supported by a
community of developers and LEGO enthusiasts around the world. Improvements are
made almost every day, with the lead developers actively engaging with the
community for ideas, bug fixes, and brand new features. 

So grab your LEGO sets and [start coding](https://code.pybricks.com)!
