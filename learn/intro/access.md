Pybricks is an <a href="https://github.com/pybricks" target="_blank">open
source</a> project with several features available exclusively to supporters.
Your support helps us continuously improve Pybricks with exciting new features,
user guides, and inspiring example projects. Read more about
[our mission here](/learn/intro/story-mission/).

Coding with Python is free. Coding with blocks is available exclusively to our
supporters. You can get access with a monthly subscription or a one-time
purchase. Thank you for your support!

If you're undecided, check out our [introduction](/learn/) to see how
Pybricks helps students, teachers, [robotics teams](/learn/#pybricks-for-robotics-teams),
and [hobbyists](/learn/#pybricks-for-lego-enthusiasts) learn to code and get
the most out of their LEGO® kits.

# Unlock block coding with a license

You can purchase a license in our store. You'll receive an email
with one or more codes that you can activate [as shown below][using-license].

<a href="https://pybricks.onfastspring.com/" target="_blank" class="btn btn--primary"><i class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Visit the Pybricks store</a>

This is a one-time purchase that you can keep using without creating any
accounts. Localized payment options are available. These licenses work even
when you're offline.

We have licenses for individuals, teams, and schools—either annual
or [perpetual][perpetual]. Schools are welcome to request a free trial for the
school license. Just email us at [sales@pybricks.com](mailto:sales@pybricks.com).

If your organization prefers to receive a quote or use purchase orders, you may email
us as well. Please send us your billing address, and Tax Exempt
ID or VAT ID if applicable.

Before you purchase, please make sure your system
is [compatible]. To be sure, you can
follow the [installation guide] and run [your first program]
without special access. Then you'll know that it works, and the
hardest part is already out of the way!

By purchasing a license, you agree to the [terms and conditions](/legal/).
Please contact us at [sales@pybricks.com](mailto:sales@pybricks.com) for more
options, volume discounts, or participation in our affiliate program.

## How to unlock the app with a license

You'll be prompted to sign in automatically when you open a block project in
the <a href="https://code.pybricks.com/" target="_blank">Pybricks app</a>. Or
just click the user icon in the top right corner.

Enter your license code and click _Activate_, as shown below.

You can see the status of your license by clicking on the user icon again. This
also lets you deactivate your license so you can use it on another device.

If you experience any issues signing in, please [email us](mailto:sales@pybricks.com).
For technical support and questions, please use the [support page][support].

## What does "perpetual" mean?

Some of our licenses have a perpetual duration. This means that you will not be
charged again after the initial purchase. You will receive future updates and
add-ons for free.

You can even deactivate the license and use it on another device.

However, we cannot guarantee indefinite support or that the web app
will function flawlessly forever. As technology evolves and circumstances
change, maintaining compatibility and providing support for older devices,
operating systems, and browsers may become impractical or untenable.

This is why we kindly ask you to run a test program first. You can check
[compatibility][compatible], try the [installation][installation guide], and
run [your first program] before making a purchase. That way you know that
everything works, and the hardest part is already out of the way!

Please see the [terms and conditions](/legal/) for more details.

# For fans and casual users

Instead of using a license, you can unlock access to block
coding by supporting us monthly on the creator platform Patreon. You can try out Pybricks block
coding for free and cancel anytime.

All tiers unlock block coding. Choose a different tier to
support our initiatives like LEGO MINDSTORMS support. Thank you!

<a href="https://www.patreon.com/pybricks/membership" target="_blank" class="btn btn--primary"><i class="fas fa-user"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Join on Patreon</a>

Once you're signed up, you can unlock the app using your
Patreon account when you open a block coding project.

If you decide to switch to a license code later, don't forget to <a href="http://patreon.com/settings/memberships/pybricks" target="_blank">cancel</a> your monthly subscription. You can stay on or rejoin
as a free member if you still want to receive fan updates.
