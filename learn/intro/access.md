Pybricks is an <a href ="https://github.com/pybricks" target="_blank">open
source</a> project with several features available exclusively to supporters.
Your support helps us continuously improve Pybricks with exciting new features,
user guides, and inspiring example projects. Read more about
[our mission here](/learn/intro/story-mission/).

Coding with Python is free. Coding with blocks is available exclusively to our
supporters. You can get access with a monthly subscription or a one-time
purchase. Thanks for your support!

If you're undecided, check out our [introduction](/learn/) to see how
Pybricks helps students, teachers, [robotics teams](/learn/#pybricks-for-robotics-teams),
and [hobbyists](/learn/#pybricks-for-lego-enthusiasts) learn to code and get
the most out of their LEGOÂ® kits.

# Option 1: Use Patreon

A monthly subscription via the creator platform _Patreon_ is a good option if
you'd like to try out Pybricks block coding for free and cancel anytime.

<a href="https://www.patreon.com/pybricks/membership" target="_blank" class="btn btn--primary"><i class="fas fa-user"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Join on Patreon</a>

Once you're signed up, you can unlock the app using your
Patreon account when you open a block coding project.

If you decide to switch to a license code later, don't forget to <a href="http://patreon.com/settings/memberships/pybricks" target="_blank">cancel</a> your monthly subscription. You can stay on or rejoin
as a free member if you still want to receive news updates.

<small>By signing up, you agree to the [terms and conditions](/legal).</small>

# Option 2: Purchase a licence

You can purchase a licence in our store. You'll receive an email
with one or more codes that you can activate [as shown below][using-license].

<a href="https://pybricks.onfastspring.com/" target="_blank" class="btn btn--primary"><i class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Visit the Pybricks store</a>

A licence works well if you prefer a one-time purchase without making any
accounts. Localized payment options are available. The license works even when
you're offline.

We have licenses for individuals, teams, schools, and companies. Either annual or perpetual. Read what this means [here][perpetual].

Before you purchase, please make sure your system
is [compatible]. To be sure, you can
follow the [installation guide] and run [your first program]
without special access. Then you'll know that it works, and the
hardest part is already out of the way!

<small>By purchasing a license, you agree to the [terms and conditions](/legal/).</small>

Please contact us at [sales@pybricks.com](mailto:sales@pybricks.com) for more
options, volume discounts, or participation in our affiliate program.

## How to unlock the app with a license

You'll be prompted to sign in automatically when you open a block project in
the <a href="https://code.pybricks.com/" target="_blank">Pybricks app</a>. Or
just click the user icon in the top right corner.

Enter your licence code and click _Activate_, as shown below.

You can see the status of your license by clicking on the user icon again. This
also lets you deactivate your license so you can use it on another device.

If you experience any issues signing in, please [email us](mailto:sales@pybricks.com).
For technical support and questions, please use the [support page][support].

## What does "perpetual" mean?

Some of our licenses have a perpetual duration. This means that you will not be
charged again after the initial purchase. You will receive future updates and
add-ons for free.

You can even deactivate the license and use it on another device.

However, we cannot guarantee indefinite support or commitment that the web app
will function flawlessly forever. As technology evolves and circumstances
change, maintaining compatibility and providing support for older devices,
operating systems, and browsers may become impractical or untenable.

This is why we kindly ask you to run a test program first. You can check
[compatibility][compatible], try the [installation][installation guide] and
run [your first program] before making a purchase. That way you know that
everything works, and the hardest part is already out of the way!

Please see the [terms and conditions](/legal/) for more details.
