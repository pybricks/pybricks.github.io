title: "What can you make with Pybricks?"
excerpt: >
  Whether you build robots, trains, cars, or cities, the possibilities are
  endless with Pybricks. Here's some inspiration to get you started.

If your recent LEGO set has batteries, chances are it can run Pybricks. No
matter your favorite LEGO theme, you can get creative and start inventing.
Here's just a few highlights for inspiration!

# LEGO® SPIKE Prime

Pybricks is becoming increasingly popular among FLL and WRO teams, who have
successfully obtained high scores and competition wins.

This is a good short example of accurate navigation with Pybricks in competitions.

You can do much more beyond competitions, too!

# LEGO® SPIKE Essential

Despite having just two ports, the SPIKE Essential set lets you get creative
since Pybricks programs truly run on the hub, instead of running on the tablet.
You can use the [button as a sensor](/project/spike-essential-tic-tac-toe/) in your programs too.

# LEGO® MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor

While the official LEGO® MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor set is discontinued, Pybricks
will support it long after the official app disappears. Pybricks run a _lot_
faster too, so you can even make a robot
that [balances itself](/project/lego-mindstorms-ball-balancer/) on the ball
that comes with the set.

# LEGO® Technic

With Pybricks, your LEGO® [Technic](/project/technic/) hub works just like a MINDSTORMS® hub. This
means it can run all by itself, without having your phone connected all the time.

You can also connect the [LEGO train remote](/project/powered-up-remote/) or
the [Xbox Controller](/project/xbox-controller/) directly to
the hub, for very responsive operation without having to work with a touch
screen.

# LEGO® City Trains

Out of the box, LEGO trains are primarily remote controlled. You can do that
with Pybricks too, but you can also make your trains run by themselves! By
adding a color sensor, you can detect markers on the track. This lets you
make them work interactively, so you don't need to build endless loops.

You can automate your rail switches too.

# LEGO® BOOST & City

With Pybricks, your LEGO BOOST set becomes much like a junior MINDSTORMS! You
can learn many of the same coding and building techniques, with a much lower
cost set.

The same applies to the City Hub, which you can use to automate all
kinds of LEGO sets.

# Hub to Hub communication

Because Pybricks makes all your smart LEGO hubs the same, they can all run
autonomous programs and communicate with each other wirelessly. This lets you
create big machines or a network of small machines that work together.

You can even take this technique beyond LEGO hubs. This lets you communicate
with other Bluetooth enabled devices such as certain Arduino boards.
