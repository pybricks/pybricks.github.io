There are numerous tools and apps for learning to program, but what makes a
_good_ learning experience? And what about the _robotics_ aspect? How do you
make it _simple_, but not _simplistic_?
How do you bridge the gap between basic Sratch-like coding to real-world
Python programming in a way that makes sense?

With many years of experience in teaching coding and robotics, we aimed to build
the best possible tool for playing and coding with smart LEGO bricks. Instead
of creating a whole new app for every new product, we took a step back and
designed a unified play experience, in such a way that it is easy to get started
without putting a limit on what the user can do.

This page explains how Pybricks was designed. You won't need this introduction
to get started. We'll cover each of these topics in the chapters that follow.

# A fresh take on coding and robotics

To give you a sense of how Pybricks was designed, we'll highlight just a few
design decisions we've made along the way. By designing Pybricks specifically
for physical robots (instead of 2D computer screens), we were able to avoid
some of the pitfalls found in other block-based languages. And by starting with
the firmware and Python layer underneath, we were able to make a gradual
transition in the learning process, rather than having Python as a completely
disconnected experience.

## Robotics, Scratch, and events

The Scratch language is incredible in many ways, but it was designed for
_computers_, not _robots_. The difference may seem subtle at first, but it
makes a big difference for coding and teaching in practice.

On a computer with on-screen graphics, everything happens _instantly_. You
click a button and a sprite instantly appears on a new position. This works
intuitively with _events_. When _this_ happens, do _that_ immediately.

Robots don't work that way. Like humans, robots take time to complete actions.
Moving a motor takes time. Playing a sound takes time. Even
pressing-and-releasing a button takes some time --- there's no such thing as an
instant button _click event_.

Consider the following seemingly trivial problem: You want to complete two
different motor moves at the same time. When both of these are complete, you
want to play a sound and repeat the whole process four times.

The original Scratch does not have to deal with this kind of problem. On-screen
graphics just appear immediately so explicit multitasking isn't needed. So when
you do it in LEGO apps _based on Scratch_, you don't have the right tools for this.
You'd have to make multiple event stacks, so-called broadcasts and lock
variables to make the stacks wait on each other. This is very complicated to
get right for beginners, and it isn't necessarily the best way to learn.

In Pybricks, there is a dedicated block to run two or more tasks at the same
time, and continue with the rest of the program when all tasks are complete. The
completed program below is very easy to follow as a result.

path="multitask_basic"

## Measurements and the real world

A robot's environment isn't perfect. Wheels
might slip, or a sensor might occasionally give the wrong value. Speeds don't
change instantly, but there is an acceleration phase that depends on how the
robot is built.

To make such things more practical to deal with, we use _measurable_ units for
everything in Pybricks wherever possible. For example, you can steer your robot
at a specified number of degrees per second, instead of steering at an
arbitrary `75%`.

To further encourage students to carefully measure and design their robot,
we've added an explicit set up section to the block coding interface. Students
can describe how their robot is built and specify which devices are plugged in.

This may take an extra minute to get used to at first, but it's a big time
saver in the long run, especially for medium to large programs. The rest of the
program can refer to these motors and sensors by _name_ rather than port code,
which is much less error prone. It makes collaboration between team members easier
too, since they can instantly see what their code does.

{% include block-program.html
path="drive"
%}

By setting up the drive base width and wheel diameter, users can navigate the
robot in _measurable_ units too. You specify the number of degrees that the
robot turns, rather than how much the wheels turn.

Some might argue that this takes a way a learning opportunity, but we would
argue the opposite. We often saw students _guess and tune_ the
number of motor degrees in other apps to get it _just right_, rather than
measure and calculate the required amount.
By abstracting some of the math away, we want to encourage students to do real
measurements and learn how each configuration parameter affects performance.

For example, you can tell it to drive `250 mm` but you might measure it to be
`243 mm` in your design in practice. This let students investigate _why_ this
happens instead of fiddling with arbitrary degree value until it works for a
particular robot. Did a wheel slip? Did the tyre compress under weight,
effectively making the diameter smaller?

This allows students to focus on the real challenges of navigation with sensors
and problem solving. Senior teams can still learn about π and do everything
manually if they want to go for even better performance.

## A good Python experience

Like Scratch, Python was originally designed for computers rather than physical
systems. Out of the box, code runs _sequentially_ from top to bottom, one thing
at a time. To fix it, Python introduced so-called _asynchronous multitasking_
with with the `async` and `await` syntax. This lets you do something else while
another task is waiting to complete. It works great, but it is also completely
unsuitable for beginning coders.

This creates a conundrum: do you create a Python experience that avoids this to
make it easier, but limits what you can do? This was done in the MINDSTORMS app
and the SPIKE V2.0 app, and almost all other apps that generate code from
blocks. Or do you overcome these limits but make it much harder? This is the
approach of the SPIKE V3.0 app.

In Pybricks, you can do both. You can start with the simpler sequential code.
You can gradually add asynchronous code when you are ready to use it. This is
true even if you use block-based coding. It generates sequential code that is
easy to learn from, but it adds the required additional code when you use a
multi-tasking block or multiple start blocks.

{% capture code_block %}

------------

If you don't need multitasking, you can write synchronous (sequential) code,
which is easier for beginners:

```python
from pybricks.hubs import PrimeHub
from pybricks.parameters import Port
from pybricks.pupdevices import Motor

# Set up all devices.
hub = PrimeHub()
gripper = Motor(Port.A)
hatch = Motor(Port.B)

for count in range(4):
    # Move the gripper, then the hatch, then play a sound.
    gripper.run_angle(speed=500, rotation_angle=90)
    hatch.run_angle(speed=-200, rotation_angle=45)
    hub.speaker.beep(frequency=500, duration=100)
```

Advanced users can use asynchronous code. This corresponds to the multi-tasking
example made with blocks above:

```python
from pybricks.hubs import PrimeHub
from pybricks.parameters import Port
from pybricks.pupdevices import Motor
from pybricks.tools import multitask, run_task, wait

# Set up all devices.
hub = PrimeHub()
gripper = Motor(Port.A)
hatch = Motor(Port.B)

async def main():
    for count in range(4):
        # Simultaneously run the gripper and move the hatch.
        await multitask(
          gripper.run_angle(speed=500, rotation_angle=90),
          hatch.run_angle(speed=-200, rotation_angle=45)
        )
        # Then play a sound.
        await hub.speaker.beep(frequency=500, duration=100)

# Run main asynchronous task.
run_task(main())
```

{% endcapture %}

Besides this conceptual difference, you'll also find many smaller but helpful
differences. For example, you can see the code being generated live as you
move blocks around. You can see documentation for all available Python functions,
not just the LEGO-specific functions. You can use the interactive terminal, and
you can split your program into multiple modules to better organize it like
real Python code. Advanced users can also use Pybricks in their favorite local
code editor. Finally, you'll get descriptive error messages to help you debug
your projects.

# Life long learning with LEGO®

We have always been huge fans of the LEGO® product and brand. It has been a big
part of our childhood, and it's very exciting to pass on these learning
experiences to the next generation. But if only the best is good enough,
there is some real work left to do.

You can still build with physical bricks from decades ago, but certain "smart"
bricks sold as recently as 2020 are getting almost impossible to use as their
corresponding LEGO® apps are discontinued from the Google and Apple app stores.

This leaves you with an expensive paperweight, and it creates a big pile of
e-waste worldwide. We think The LEGO Group can do much better! With Pybricks,
we're hoping to demonstrate that this can certainly be done.

Since we've open sourced our Pybricks firmware and Python coding interface, it
should be possible to use Pybricks long after the official products and their
apps retire. This ensures you can still play with your smart LEGO® bricks
decades from now, just as you can with any other physical brick!
