Now that your hub is up and running with Pybricks, let's have a look around the
Pybricks app before diving into all the blocks.

In this section, you'll learn how to create, run, and back up programs. You'll
also learn how turn the hub on and off, and start programs when you're away
from your computer.

# Exploring the app

Previously, you've visited the _tools_ menu to install the firmware. You can
also open the _file manager_ as shown below. The programs you create can
be opened from here.

At the top, you'll find buttons to interact with the hub. Once connected,
several buttons to start and stop your program will be enabled. If a program
produces any text output, it will be shown in the output window at the bottom.

{% include diagram.html data=page.code_overview %}

## Using the documentation

The guide you're reading now explains _how_ you can use many of the
available blocks. It also tells you _why_ you might want to use them,
and in which situation.

But sometimes you just want to quickly look up _what_ a particular block or
setting does. That's where the documentation comes in. You can open and close
it using the book icon on the right hand side of the app. If you use
block-based coding, just right-click on any block and choose _help_ to jump to
the relevant page.

## Checking your account status

Click the user icon to check your account status, as shown above. Here you can
sign in to access block coding. You can access block coding by becoming a
Patreon supporter or purchasing a license code. You can find the details
[here](/learn/intro/access/).

# Creating your first program

Let's start by creating a very simple program that prints some text to your
computer screen. To begin, open the _file menu_
and start creating a new program using the + icon, as shown below. Choose
block coding, enter a program name, and click _Create_.

As you type a program name, you'll get suggestions in case the name can't be
used. In that case, click _Fix it for me_ to adjust it automatically.

{% include diagram.html data=page.code_create_new %}

Your new program contains a few blocks already. There's a yellow _setup_ and
_start_ block, as well as a blue print block. We'll get to the details of these
in the next chapters. For now, just move some of the blocks around to
get a feel for how this works.

If you're here to test your system prior to getting access to Pybricks block
coding, you can run the default program without adding any
blocks. Skip to the next 
[section](/learn/getting-started/pybricks-environment/#connecting-to-the-hub) to
learn how to run it. You'll see `Hello, Pybricks!` in the output pane.
{: .notice}

Next, open the _Flow_ blocks tab and select the _Wait_ block. Place it on the
canvas and adjust the wait time as shown below. Also be sure to close the
file menu to free up space on the screen.

{% include diagram.html data=page.code_add_wait %}

Next, pick the _Print_ block from the _Output_ tab and attach it to the stack
of blocks you've built already, as shown below.

{% include diagram.html data=page.code_add_print %}

Congratulations, you've just created your first program! It should:
- Print `Hello, Pybricks!` to the output pane of the app.
- Wait 5 seconds.
- Print `Have a nice day!`

# Connecting to the hub


You'll now learn to connect to the hub so you can verify that your program
works. Turn on the hub. It should blink a blue light, which means
it is ready to connect. Click the _Bluetooth_ button as shown below, choose
your hub and click _Pair_.

If you haven't already done so, install the Pybricks firmware
first, as discussed in the [previous section](./install-pybricks.md).
{: .notice--warning}

{% include diagram.html data=page.code_connect %}

Once connected, you can check the hub status at the bottom of your screen.
You'll see the hub name and version. If your hub battery is low, you'll see it
there as well.

# Starting and stopping programs

Now that the hub is connected, click the play (▶) button to start your
program. Small programs like these run almost right away.

{% include diagram.html data=page.code_run %}

You should now see the result at the bottom of your screen.
You can unfold or increase the size using the handle in the center as needed.

The program starts with the `Hello, Pybricks!` message. Then it waits for 5
seconds, and prints the `Have a nice day!` message. The end result is:

```
Hello, Pybricks!
Have a nice day!
```

If you run it again, it adds the same output another time. To clear any output,
right-click on the text and choose _Clear_.

If a program is running, you can stop it with the ⏹-button. To try this out,
start the program again and press stop right away. The output will be:

```
Hello, Pybricks!
The program was stopped (SystemExit).
```

This is because it printed the first message right away, but you stopped it
before the second message would print after 5 seconds.


**Note** ⸺ A Pybricks program ends when the last block completes. Movement
and sound stops. In Scratch, it keeps running even after all blocks complete. 
{: .notice}

# Start programs with the hub button

Once you've run your program once, you don't need your computer to run it
again! Just press the hub (center) button to start it, even when you're
disconnected from the computer.

The program you've just made doesn't do much, but you can still tell that it's
running from the slowly fading blue status light, as shown in the table below.

Press the (center) button again to stop a program if it is running. This works
no matter how you started it.

To turn the hub off, hold the (center) button for three seconds. If the hub is
not connected and no program is running, it will shut down after a few minutes
of inactivity.

**Note** ⸺ Programs are saved persistently during shutdown. If you pull the
hub batteries _before shutting down normally_, your program won't be saved.
{: .notice}

You can tell whether a program is running by looking at the status light.
This table shows a
rectangular light, but the round light of the Prime Hub or Inventor hub
blinks the same way.

| | Pattern | Description |
|-|---------|-------------|
| ![blue 100ms, off 200ms, blue 100ms, off 2200ms](/learn/getting-started/light-listening.png) | Blinking blue | Program is _not_ running. Ready to connect. |
| ![solid blue](/learn/getting-started/light-connected.png) | Solid blue | Program is _not_ running. Connected. |
| ![breathing blue 2000ms cycle](/learn/getting-started/light-program-running.png) | Fading blue | Program is running. (Either with or without a connection, it looks the same.)|

You'll see the following indications less often, but it's still useful to know
what they mean. If you change the light color in your program, you'll still
see the orange on top of your own color to remind you to charge the battery.

| | Pattern | Description |
|-|---------|-------------|
| ![low-battery](/learn/getting-started/light-low-battery.png) | Blinking orange | Low battery. |
|-|---------|-------------|
| ![light purple 500ms, off 100ms](/learn/getting-started/light-bootloader-listening.png) | Blinking or steady purple | Ready to enter update mode. |
| ![red 500ms, green 500ms, blue 500ms, off 100ms](/learn/getting-started/light-bootloader-connected.png) | Red, green, and blue blinks | Update mode active. |

# The coding canvas

As you made your first program, you might have come across several buttons
on the coding canvas, as shown below. Anywhere on the canvas, you can zoom the
blocks in or out by scrolling with your mouse or by pinch a touch screen.

{% include diagram.html data=page.code_buttons %}

From top to bottom, you'll find:

- _Download screenshot_: This is useful to share or present your work
  conveniently, even if your code is too big for a conventional screenshot.
- _Toggle documentation_: You can open the documentation to browse the block
  reference or close it for more space.
- _Toggle Python code_: You can see the Python code being generated live as you
  move blocks around. 
- _Align blocks_: As your code grows, this can help you conveniently align your
code in a single column.
- _Zoom to fit_: Helps you keep the overview of a large program.
- _Trashcan_: You'll find deleted blocks here. You can take the blocks out
  if you change your mind. The trash is emptied when you load a new program
  or switch tabs.

You can close the Python code if you don't need it. Note that you can't edit
the generated code yourself, since you would lose your changes every time you
moved a block. Instead you can _copy_ the code to a new Python program and
adjust it there as you like.

# Copying and deleting blocks

You can select a block by clicking or tapping on it. Hold shift and click
additional blocks to select more. You can also hold shift to encircle a larger
group of blocks, as shown below.

{% include diagram.html data=page.img_setup_select %}

You can copy a selection via the right-click context menu, or use familiar
keyboard shortcuts such as <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>
and <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd>.

Use <kbd>Delete</kbd> to delete selected of blocks. Alternatively, drag them
back onto the block palette or into the trash can. If you change your mind,
click on the trashcan to see deleted blocks.
Note that the trash will be emptied when you close your program or switch to
a different program.

Use the familiar shortcuts <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>z</kbd> (or similar) to undo
changes you've made.

# Managing program files

You can find your block programs and Python programs on the files tab. Hover
over any program to see options to _rename_, _duplicate_, _back up_ or _delete_
a file, as shown below.

The files are stored within your own browser and can be used offline. They will
be deleted if you delete your browser data.

As with any digital project, it is a
good idea to occasionally back them up to a place where you can easily find
them. For convenience, you can also back up or restore all programs at once,
using the buttons at the top. 

{% include diagram.html data=page.code_rename %}

# Further exploration

In this section, you've learned how to create and run basic programs for your
robot. It's a good idea to play around with the code editor some more before
diving into the details of all the blocks you can use. These challenges will
help you get started.

**Challenge #1A: Countdown clock** ⸺ Can you modify the example program to count
down from 10 to 0? _Hint:_ You'll need 11 wait blocks and 11 print blocks.
You could type the numbers directly, or write your own notes such as "Time is up!"
{: .notice--primary}

**Challenge #1B: Twinkle Twinkle Star** ⸺ Can you expand the program you've just
created to display the lyrics of _Twinkle Twinkle Star_? Look up the lyrics and
use a Print block for each line. Ensure the timing between each line is just
right by setting the time in the Wait blocks as required.
{: .notice--primary}

**Challenge #1C: Timing the Wait block** ⸺ The Wait block lets you specify
a time to wait in milliseconds. But is it accurate? It never hurts to verify
if a robot is really doing what you tell it to. Use print statements and a
stopwatch on your phone to determine how well it works.
{: .notice--primary}

**Challenge #1D: File management** ⸺ You can back up one program, or all
programs at once as a ZIP archive. Can you download this ZIP archive, and open
it with Pybricks on another computer? You could send it by email or save it
to a service like Dropbox.
{: .notice--primary}

**Challenge #1E: Python calculator** ⸺ Even though we won't be working with
Python for a while, there's a few things you can explore already. Click the
`>>>` key at the top to start the interactive prompt. In the output window
at the bottom, try typing `5+5` and press _enter_. Do you get the expected
result? You can also try other expressions such as `5 * 4 * 3`. Use the stop
button to exit this prompt.
{: .notice--primary}
