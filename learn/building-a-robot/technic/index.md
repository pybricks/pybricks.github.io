The Technic Hub is internally very similar to the SPIKE Prime Hub. This means
you can follow along with almost every lesson without changes.

{% include scaled.html path="/learn/building-a-robot/technic/starterbot-technic-line.jpg" %}

You can build your StarterBot with one Technic Hub, two
[motors](/learn/getting-started/what-do-you-need/#choosing-motors) and one or
two sensors. This page shows some pictures for inspiration, but you can build
something similar with the pieces already in your collection.

# Building a base

A robot drive base consists of two wheels, each powered by one motor, and a
support wheel in the back. The motors pictured above make it very easy to mount
the Technic hub directly on top. If you have other motors, you can use gears to
drive the wheels if needed.

You can use any type of wheel. Later on, you'll set up the
code to match the wheel size and width of your robot.

# The support wheel

The rear of the robot has to be supported so it can move freely. You
could use:
- A swivel wheel as pictured above (see [instructions](/learn/building-a-robot/mindstorms-inventor/starterbot-inventor-05.png))
- A ball caster (see the [SPIKE variant](/learn/building-a-robot/spike-prime/))
- A sliding contact (see the [City variant](/learn/building-a-robot/city/))

# Adding sensors

You can use the same sensors as used on
the [SPIKE Prime](/learn/building-a-robot/spike-prime/) StarterBot if you
already have them, but
the {% include setlink.html id=88007 %} is generally the more affordable option.

It can measure color as well as rough distance, which makes it
quite versatile. You can mount it facing downward or forward, depending on the
application. You could also use two of these sensors at the same time.
