Building a vehicle robot is a great way to get familiar with robotics and
coding. We'll show you how to build one using SPIKE, MINDSTORMS, Technic, City,
or BOOST. You can also use your own design or competition robot. 

The StarterBot for SPIKE Prime and MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor is the most
complete. Use one of these if you want to recreate all programming examples
without any changes.

If you use Technic, City, BOOST, or SPIKE Essential, we'll show you how to
adjust the lessons and examples as you go.

# SPIKE Prime

You can build this version of StarterBot with just the elements in the {%
include setlink.html id=45678 %} base set.

{% include scaled.html
  path="/learn/building-a-robot/spike-prime/"
  path_small="/learn/building-a-robot/spike-prime/starterbot-prime.png"
%}

# MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor

You can build this version of StarterBot with just the elements in the {%
include setlink.html id=51515 %} base set. It is almost entirely the same as
the SPIKE Prime version, but it uses a swivel wheel instead of a ball caster.

Instructions coming soon!

# SPIKE Essential

You can build this version of StarterBot with the {% include setlink.html
id=45345 %} set. You can start off following the first chapters in this guide
without any sensors.

Since this hub has only two ports, you cannot combine driving with sensors, but
we'll show you how to adapt the lessons to learn about sensors while using just
one motor.

Instructions coming later this year. In the meantime, you can use any of the
standard designs that drive with two wheels.

# Technic

You can build this version of StarterBot with a Technic Hub and two motors. You
can also make a variant with other motors and wheels.

You can start following this guide without any sensors. To follow along with the
chapters about sensors, the {% include setlink.html id=88007 %} is the most
affordable and versatile option.

Instructions coming later this year. Build your own two-wheeled robot for now!
{: .notice--primary}

# BOOST

You can use the {% include setlink.html id=17101 %} set or the
{% include setlink.html id=75253 %} set to build this version of StarterBot.

You'll use the hub's builtin motor to drive. The color and distance sensor that
comes in the box lets you follow along with most lessons.

Instructions coming later this year. Build your own two-wheeled robot for now!

# City

You can build this version of StarterBot with a City Hub and two motors. You
can start off following the first chapters in this guide without any sensors.

Since this hub has only two ports, you cannot combine driving with sensors, but
we'll show you how to adapt the lessons to learn about sensors while using just
one motor.
