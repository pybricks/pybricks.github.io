Building a vehicle robot is a great way to get familiar with robotics and
coding. A basic robot consists of two wheels, each powered by a motor, and a
support in the back. We'll show you how to build such a _StarterBot_ using
SPIKE, MINDSTORMS, Technic, City, or BOOST.

**Tip** â¸º You can also use your own design or competition robot. You'll learn
to adapt the code to your design along the way. However, it can be
refreshing to take a break from the competition and learn new skills using
a different robot.

# SPIKE Prime

You can build this version of StarterBot with just the elements in the {%
include setlink.html id=45678 %} base set.

It can run all example projects in this guide without changes.

# MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor

You can build this version of StarterBot with just the elements in the {%
include setlink.html id=51515 %} base set.

It can run all example projects in this guide without changes.

# SPIKE Essential

You can build this version of StarterBot with the {% include setlink.html
id=45345 %} set. You can start off following the first chapters in this guide
without any sensors.

Since this hub has only two ports, you cannot combine driving with external
sensors, but we'll show you how to adapt the lessons to learn about sensors
while using just one motor.

%}


# Technic

You can build this version of StarterBot with a Technic Hub and two motors. You
can also make a variant with other motors and wheels.

You can start following this guide without any sensors. To follow along with the
chapters about sensors, the {% include setlink.html id=88007 %} is the most
affordable and versatile option.

%}


# BOOST

You can use the {% include setlink.html id=17101 %} set or the
{% include setlink.html id=75253 %} set to build this version of StarterBot.

You'll use the hub's builtin motor to drive. The color and distance sensor that
comes in the box lets you follow along with most lessons.

# City

You can build this version of StarterBot with a City Hub and two motors. You
can start off following the first chapters in this guide without any sensors.

Since this hub has only two ports, you cannot combine driving with sensors, but
we'll show you how to adapt the lessons to learn about sensors while using just
one motor.
