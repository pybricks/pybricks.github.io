You can build this version of StarterBot with a City Hub and two motors. You can
use any kind of motors
with [rotation sensors](/learn/getting-started/what-do-you-need/#choosing-motors).

# Adapting the lessons

All coding techniques in this guide also apply to the City Hub. You can use
the same code blocks. But since this hub has only two ports, you cannot drive
with two motors and use other sensors at the same time.

You can still follow most of the early chapters concerning driving and
navigation without many changes. For lessons about sensors, you can modify
the examples to use only one motor.

For example, instead of making a robot drive until a colored line, you could
make a motor spin until the color sensor detects a certain color. This way, you
can still learn about most sensor techniques.

# Instructions

Since everyone is likely to have a different combination of elements, we did
not draw step-by-step instructions for this one.

In essence, you just need
to connect the two motors to your hub, and add two wheels. You can build a
swivel wheel for support or simply use a rounded element as shown here.
