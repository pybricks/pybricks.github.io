The BOOST Move Hub is unique because it has two motors builtin already. You can
use these to make a BOOST variant of the StarterBot very quickly.
You can also use one of the standard robots using the instructions that come
with the kit.

# How to build it 

The hub is placed upright in this design. This ensures that most of the weight
of the motors and batteries rests on the powered wheels. This creates extra
grip, which makes its movements much more accurate.

You can adjust the design if you want to use bigger wheels. The BOOST set also
contains many elements to make this quick build look a bit more interesting.

# Adding sensors

The BOOST set comes with
the {% include setlink.html id=88007 %} which works well for most of the
lessons. By mounting it on the robot as shown above, you can easily tilt it to
face either downward or forward, depending on the application at hand.
