Previously, you've learned to use Repeat blocks, Wait blocks and Task blocks
to change in which _order_ your blocks run. In all
of these cases, there was just one action going on at a time.

Sometimes it is useful to do two or more things _at the same time_, known as
_multitasking_. For example, a truck plays a warning sound while driving
backwards, and a robotic arm moves multiple joints at once for smoother motion.

You can do this in your program using multiple Start blocks or using the
Multitask block, as shown below. You'll learn to use both techniques in this
section.

{% include diagram.html data=page.img_multitask_blocks %}


# Using multiple Start blocks

The simplest way to do two things at once is by placing another Start block on
the canvas. All Start blocks begin running at the same time, no matter where
they are placed. The program ends when both have finished running all blocks
that are attached to them.

Consider the following example, which runs one motor back and forth under one
Start block. At the same time, a Repeat Times block under another Start block
blinks the hub light red and green ten times.

{% include block-program.html
path="L04_3_starts"
caption="You can do multiple things at once by adding more Start blocks to the
canvas."
width="80%"
%}

In principle, you can add as many Start blocks to the canvas as you like. In
practice, your program can become unwieldy and hard to follow if you add too
many. For many applications, the Multitask block is more effective, as you'll
see next.

# Using the Multitask block

When your program arrives at a _Multitask_ block, it will run two or more
stacks of blocks placed within it at the same time. Consider the following
example, which runs one motor back and forth. At the same time, a Repeat Times
block blinks the hub light red and green ten times. 

{% include block-program.html
path="L04_3_multitask"
caption="You can also do multiple things at once with the Multitask block."
width="80%"
%}

If this sounds familiar, that's because this example is _identical_ to the
program with two Start blocks from before. What's the point then, you ask? To
see why it is useful, add two sound blocks to create the following example:

{% include block-program.html
path="L04_3_multitask_sound"
caption="With multiple Start blocks, you essentially make two whole programs
run separately at the same time. With the Multitask block, you choose where
multitasking begins and ends, which is more practical in most cases."
width="80%"
%}

Now the robot plays a sound, runs the motor back and forth while blinking the light
as before, and then plays another sound. As trivial as this may look, you might
be surprised to learn that this is much harder to build using two Start blocks.

This is where the Multitask block shines. It can do the same as multiple Start blocks,
but you can _choose where and when_ to use it like any other block, rather than
only use it at the very beginning of your program.

If you've programmed with Scratch before, you might have used Broadcast blocks
to make multiple stacks of blocks wait on each other. You don't need these with
the Multitask block. This keeps programs much simpler and easier to follow,
especially when they grow bigger.

# Multitasking with Task Caller blocks

You can organize your program differently by placing the blocks for back and
forth movement and the blinking light in their own Task blocks. Then you can
place their Task Caller blocks in the Multitask block, as shown below.

{% include block-program.html
path="L04_3_multitask_task"
caption="You can convert both stacks of blocks into their own respective task,
         and make them run at the same time."
width="100%"
%}

Organizing your code like this is a matter of preference, but it can be helpful
for large programs. Now you can see why this block is called the Multitask
block: it runs multiple tasks at once. Under the hood, this program is
identical to the previous example.

# Conflicting resources

You can run more than two tasks at once by expanding the Multitask block with
the v-shaped symbol at the bottom For example, your robot could simultaneously
rotate a motor, play a sound, blink a light, and print some text, as shown
below.


{% include block-program.html
path="L04_3_multitask_multiple"
caption="Doing four things at once is no problem, as long as they don't use the
same physical resource."
width="80%"
%}

While your robot can multitask many different things, it cannot
do two _conflicting things_ at once. It can't run the very same motor forwards
and backwards at the same time, just like you can't walk forward and backward
at the same time.

The following program won't work. Nothing bad will happen, but it won't do
anything good, either. The mistake here is quite obvious, but it can be easier
to miss in a big program. In general, you should avoid having two stacks of blocks
running at the same time that try to use the same motor or sensor.
