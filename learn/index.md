# Why Pybricks?

Pybricks makes all of your smart LEGO bricks _just work_. Pybricks is designed
to be very _useful_, _practical_ -- and most of all -- _fun_.

Whether you're just getting started,
or a seasoned builder looking to build something big, Pybricks is for you.
It helps robotics teams get better results, while allowing enthusiasts to
combine and mix all their battery-powered LEGO bricks creatively for endless
possibilities.

Made by [long-term LEGO enthusiasts](/learn/intro/story-mission), Pybricks not
only unifies all the different LEGO themes, but also unlocks the full
possibilities of each set and allows you to use it far beyond its original
lifespan, even as the original apps get discontinued.

## Pybricks for robotics teams

Coding a robot is fun, but there is a lot to learn, especially at first.
You can think of Pybricks as a really useful _tool_. A good tool
doesn't do the job for you, but it certainly makes it more practical.

Pybricks was specifically designed with robotics in mind. This means you'll
get accurate and to-the-point blocks for robot navigation for example, with
support for the gyroscope built in.

You'll need fewer blocks to do the same thing. When you do need a lot
of blocks, you can break it down into separate functions or files so your team
members can work and learn together.

Or, as one team coach puts it:

> “The kids were able to code a mission in 20 minutes with Pybricks that had
> taken at least an hour to code previously.”

Even now, we're continuing to improve Pybricks specifically for this purpose,
based on feedback from students and coaches from around the world. We're proud
to play a small part in the learning journey for many teams, such as this one:

> “In addition to being the tournament Champion, we also won the Robot
> Performance award. We know the main reason that we achieved the top robot
> score is because of all the features built into Pybricks.”

## Pybricks for LEGO enthusiasts

Building with LEGO has always been about being creative and combining elements
to build amazing things. But with the recent battery-powered interactive sets,
the play experience is often _limited by what you can do using the app_ for
that set.

That way, LEGO Technic has become all about remote control using a phone
screen, LEGO train hubs are reduced to remote controlled battery boxes, SPIKE
is limited to certain classroom activities, and MINDSTORMS was discontinued
alltogether.

And yet, despite the differently colored plastic casing, they're all pretty
much the same system on the inside. Pybricks bridges the gap across these
themes, letting you use your LEGO elements as creatively as intended!

More to the point: With Pybricks installed on your Technic Hub or City Hub, it
works just like SPIKE or MINDSTORMS. So now you can save a program on the hub.
It runs all by itself, without needing a phone or tablet connection all the
time:

> “Pybricks is a powerful platform that delivers what LEGO has so far been
> unable or unwilling to: complete compatibility across the entire Powered Up
> ecosystem, and a means to download your program onto any hub and have it run
> as soon as it is switched on.”
>

Throughout this guide, you'll use a very basic "robot" to illustrate the core
principles. This is quick to build, and great for learning. Even if your end
goal is to build a fully-automated cargo train station, just attach two motors
and wheels to a hub for now and follow along. Once you've mastered the basics,
you can apply it to any other design too!

# How to follow this guide

The Pybricks _learn_ pages you're reading now are organized just like a book.
Beginners can read them from start to finish. More seasoned builders can browse
to their favorite topics right away. Just go back if you feel you're missing
some background.

Use the table of contents on the left to navigate to each chapter. The menu on
the right helps you track your progress through the current chapter.

## What prior knowledge do I need?
No prior coding experience or LEGO building experience is required. There's no
need to use other coding apps first either. You'll start with the basics and
build from there gradually.

Pybricks block-based coding is designed to be very close to real-world,
text-based coding. If you proceed to experiment with Python after
following this block-based coding guide, you'll find that all skills you gained
along the way are immediately applicable to Python too.

## Design challenges and lesson ideas

To help you better understand the concepts introduced throughout each chapter,
you'll find several challenges and puzzles to practice your skills throughout.
You'll also find suggestions for classroom activities.

While some challenges include hints or partial solutions, we encourage you to
get creative with the open ended problems. You can also share and discuss your
solutions on our [forum](https://github.com/orgs/pybricks/discussions).

# Chapter overview

This guide is broken down into several main parts. We start with the basics,
and gradually build on the skills you learn throughout.

**1. Getting started**

This chapter is all about preparing the tools you need to get started. What is
a hub, motor, or sensor? You'll also prepare your computer or tablet and
install Pybricks on your LEGO hub.

You'll learn how you create, save, and run programs. Without diving into
the details of each block just yet, you'll learn how to use the coding
interface effectively, which is a big help once you create bigger programs
later on.

- 1.1: [What do you need?](/learn/getting-started/what-do-you-need/)
- 1.2: [Installing Pybricks](/learn/getting-started/install-pybricks/)
- 1.3: [Running Pybricks programs](/learn/getting-started/pybricks-environment/)

**2. Building a robot**

A great way to learn robotics and coding principles is to build a basic vehicle
robot. It's a fun way to dive into the action right away, while getting to know
all the elements and coding techniques one by one.

[![](/learn/building-a-robot/overview-og.jpg)](/learn/building-a-robot/)

We'll show you how to build such a vehicle. You can use either SPIKE Prime,
SPIKE Essential, Mindstorms Robot Inventor, Technic, City, or BOOST. Once
you've attached some wheels to the motors, it turns out they're all pretty
much the same.

- 2.1: [Building StarterBot](/learn/getting-started/what-do-you-need/)
- 2.2: [SPIKE Prime](/learn/building-a-robot/spike-prime/)
- 2.3: [SPIKE Essential](/learn/building-a-robot/spike-essential/)
- 2.4: [MINDSTORMS](/learn/building-a-robot/mindstorms-inventor/)
- 2.5: [Technic Hub](/learn/building-a-robot/technic/)
- 2.6: [BOOST Move Hub](/learn/building-a-robot/boost/)
- 2.7: [City Hub](/learn/building-a-robot/city/)

You can also use your own robot if you prefer, by adapting the provided coding
examples to your own design. For example, you might have to adjust the wheel
diameter parameter if you use differently sized wheels.

**3. Basic robot navigation and output blocks**

Now it's time to make the robot come alive! You'll learn to use the output
blocks to make your robot move, play sounds, and blink lights. Naturally,
you'll make a "Hello, World!" program too!

- 3.1: [Your first robot program](/learn/making-programs/your-first-program/)
- 3.2: [Essential coding tools](/learn/making-programs/basic-blocks/)
- 3.3: [Basic robot navigation](/learn/making-programs/basic-robot-navigation/)
- 3.4: [Adding sound and light](/learn/making-programs/sound-light/)

**4. Waiting, repeating, and tasks**

Robots rarely execute a long, fixed list of actions from start to finish. This
chapter shows you how to wait between actions, or repeat several actions
multiple times. You'll also see how you can run multiple actions in parallel,
or how to group frequently used actions together in a dedicated _task_.

- 4.1: [Waiting and repeating](/learn/flow-basics/waiting-repeating/)
- 4.2: [Making your own task blocks](/learn/flow-basics/tasks-functions/)
- 4.3: [Multitasking essentials](/learn/flow-basics/multitasking/)
- 4.4: [Advanced multitasking](/learn/flow-basics/advanced-multitasking/)

**5. Making decisions with sensors**

The remaining chapters are a work in progress. Please check back in a few months. Thank you!
{: .notice--primary}

Robots don't operate in the world all by themselves, so they need to observe
their surroundings to decide what to do. This chapter shows you how to use
sensors to make decisions. You'll use the distance sensor to get started, and
make your robot drive around while avoiding obstacles.

**6. Using logic to make combined decisions**

A single sensor is quite easy to use, but most robots use several sensors at the
same time. How do you combine all the sensor information to do something useful?
And how do you avoid missing important information? You'll find out in this
chapter. You'll use the buttons on the hub as additional sensors, so that it
can not only detect objects, but also _where_ they are encountered.

**7. The color sensor**

This chapter shows you how to measure light intensity and color. Your robot can
use these measurements in many ways. For example, you'll learn how to make your
robot find the brightest spot in a room, and how to make it follow a line on
the floor. You'll also learn to calibrate the color sensor to make it work
reliably by adapting to your environment.

**8. Using motors effectively**

Rotating a motor might seem like a trivial task, but there are many factors
that influence how it moves. This chapter dives deeper into the motor blocks
and its various configurable settings. You'll learn how to adjust motor speed,
acceleration and control how the motor stops. You'll also learn _why_ some of
these techniques are useful in different scenarios.

**9. Navigation with the gyro sensor**

In addition to using the position sensors in the motors, you can use the
gyroscopic sensor in the hub to navigate more effectively. This chapter shows
you how this works. You'll also learn about practical aspects of using the gyro
sensor, such as calibration or combining it with other navigation tasks. We'll
also discuss the pitfalls to watch out for when using the gyro in a robot
competition.

**10. Creating and using variables**

So far, you've made your robot respond to its environment right away by
adjusting what it does based on the sensor values at that moment. In some
applications, you'll want to _remember_ certain values so you can use them
later on in your program. You'll learn to do that using so called variables.

**11. Creating and using tasks and functions**

In earlier chapters, you've briefly explored the use of _tasks_ to group
portions of code that could be reused repeatedly. This chapter dives deeper
into the use of such tasks, also known as functions. Not only will they execute
things for you, but functions can also _calculate_ things for you and give you
the result to use as an input for another block.

**12. Using lists and iterations**

A variable can store a single value, but it can also store a list of multiple
values. For example, you might have a list of target angles that the motor
should go to, one by one. This chapter shows you how to create, and modify such
lists. You'll also learn how to _iterate_ through the list. This lets you
execute some actions for each value in the list.

**13. Wireless communication**

At this point, you've mastered nearly all of the blocks on the block palette,
but the fun doesn't end there. In this chapter we'll show you how you can send
values between two or more LEGO robots. This lets you build a bigger robot, or
make multiple robots work together.
