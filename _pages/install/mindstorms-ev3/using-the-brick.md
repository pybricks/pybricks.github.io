## Turning the EV3 Brick on and off

Turn on the EV3 Brick by pressing the dark gray center button.

The boot process may take several minutes. While booting, the EV3 Brick status
light turns orange and blinks intermittently, and you'll see a lot of text on
the EV3 screen. The EV3 Brick is ready for use when the status light turns
green.

To turn the EV3 Brick off, open the shutdown menu with the back button, and
then select *Power Off* using the center button:

You can run previously downloaded programs directly from the EV3 Brick.

To do so, find the program using the *file browser* on the EV3 screen and press
the center button key to start the program:
