Pybricks is Python for smart LEGOÂ® hubs. Now you can make your LEGO Technic,
LEGO City, and LEGO MINDSTORMS creations truly come alive.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced builder or programmer, you can
start writing code with Pybricks in no time.

# What makes Pybricks different?

![](/assets/images/home-compatibility.jpg)

Pybricks provides a super easy and powerful robotics coding experience across
the full spectrum of modern LEGO sets. Sensors, motors, and programmable hubs
work the same on all platforms, with the same code.

Your code runs autonomously on the hub, which is up to 100x faster than usual.
And because Pybricks was designed to run even on low-spec devices, there's
a ton of spare CPU power and memory on the bigger hubs.

Sensors and motors operate at much higher precision, giving you full
control of your creation. Whether you want to build great *First LEGO League*
robots, smart train layouts, or stable self-balancing robots, Pybricks can
do it.

Finally, there's a clean and fast [code editor](https://code.pybricks.com)
that lets you run and stop scripts in a fraction of a second. No large app
downloads or complicated command line tools required. It works on just about
any computer, so you're not stuck on a tiny screen.

Best of all, Pybricks is fully powered by the community. It's fully
[documented](https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/) and there's an ever-growing
collection of [example projects](https://github.com/pybricks/pybricks-projects)
and [additional tools](https://github.com/pybricks)
shared by Pybricks users all around the world.

# Pybricks is open source

Pybricks is free and open source. It's released under the MIT license.
You can read, try, and even change our code via
our [GitHub page](https://github.com/pybricks/).

Pybricks builds on [MicroPython](http://micropython.org/), which is a
super-efficient version of Python that can run on the microcontrollers
inside the smart hubs.

The Pybricks team welcomes ideas and code contributions. Whether you're a new
student, teacher, or a seasoned programmer, we want to hear from you!

Please join the discussion forums or chat via
our [support page](https://github.com/pybricks/support).

# The Pybricks team

Pybricks has contributors all around the world. The core team consists of
Laurens Valk and David Lechner, who combine years of teaching, coding, and LEGO
experience to help you learn how to code and build robots.
