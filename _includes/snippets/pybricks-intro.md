# Running the Pybricks program

This project uses <a href="https://code.pybricks.com/" target="_blank">
_Pybricks_</a> on your LEGO hub. Pybricks makes your creations
come alive and helps you unlock the full potential of your LEGO _Technic_,
_City_, _MINDSTORMS_, _BOOST_, or _Spike_ sets.

If you haven't already, install Pybricks on your hub as shown below, or check
out our [getting started guide](/install) for more details. You can go
back to the LEGO firmware and apps at any time.

{% include diagram.html data="diagram-install" %}

Now import the program you <a href="#block-program">downloaded earlier</a>, as
shown below. Click <i class="fab fa-bluetooth"></i> to connect your hub and â–¶ to
start!

{% include diagram.html data="diagram-import" %}

You can run imported block programs even if you're not signed up. This is a
great way to try out Pybricks and see how it works.
